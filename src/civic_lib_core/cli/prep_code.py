"""Prepare Civic Interconnect code for release or commit.

This script:
- Checks whether the virtual environment may be stale (based on dependency file timestamps)
- Formats code using Ruff
- Lints and fixes issues with Ruff
- Runs pre-commit hooks twice (first to fix, then to verify)
- Executes unit tests via pytest

If dependency files changed since .venv was created, the script warns the user
to rerun their setup script (e.g. setup.ps1) to reinstall the environment.
